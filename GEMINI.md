Always answer in Polish. Never make changes on your own without asking. Ask explicitly before making changes. Always read Cursor's project rules. If I ask you to make corrections to mean ze in the file poprawki.md you have guidelines with code corrections. After making corrections, you must check and confirm the corrections made.
Follow my instructions precisely. Do not add new functionality without asking!
Avoid over-engineering.
Work only with PyQt6.
